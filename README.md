Prediction of city-cycle fuel consumption through Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

Domain:
Automobile

Context:
The data concerns city-cycle fuel consumption in miles per gallon, to be predicted in terms of 3 multivalued discrete and 5 continuous attributes

Objective:
Goal is to cluster the data and treat them as individual datasets to train Regression models to predict mpg
